Here's what we've got lined up for our next meet up on 13th November 2013.

[Tickets are available now via eventbrite][3].

## 6pm - Kick off

Jamie will be kicking everything off with an overview of what's lined up for the night.


## 6:10 - 6:40pm - Intro to Strings &  Namespacing.

We're carrying on the introduction to python and this month.

* Dave will be showing everyone about namespacing in python
* Kieren will be showing you more about string formatting
* Simon will be doing something, but we're not sure what just yet.


## 6:40 - 7:00pm - What you've been doing with Python.

We're looking for two people to stand up and show the group what they've been doing with python since the last meetup. It'll be two talks of strictly 10 mins - [checkout this thread for more info][0]

Kieran Darcy will be doing a talk/workshop on Flask and how to get started building a basic app. You'll be able to code along so bring your machine.

A chance to catch up with everyone from the group and to meet other python folk from the North East python scene whilst chomping on free pizza courtesy of [c&c Design][2] and [Obscure Metaphor][1].
