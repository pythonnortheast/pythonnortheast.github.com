Tickets for [our February Meetup][1] (12th of Feb) are now available. 

This meetup will be our first at the new location of [Clavering House][2] who have graciously obliged to house our meetups into the future (_thanks Li_)


We're in the process of confirming the talk and looking for someone to do a show a tell, so if you want to show the world what you've been hacking away on, then this is your chance.  If you're interested [drop us a line][3].
