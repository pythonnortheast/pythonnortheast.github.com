  <div class="entry-content"><h1>Novembers Meetup</h1>

<p>We all had a cracking time at the meetup on Tuesday and judging by the tweets, so did everyone else.  This was our third formal meetup since the group resureccted itself back in September and I think it&#8217;s safe to say that we&#8217;re finding our feet and that we&#8217;re on track to grow into a really strong community of Python Users in 2013.</p>

<p>So here&#8217;s a brief run down of events from Tuesday starting with continuing with our <a href="https://github.com/pythonnortheast/introduction-1">Introduction to Python</a> &hellip;</p>

<h2>Intro To String Formatting</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.papyrusresearch.com/about/">Kieran Darcy</a> ran eloquenty guided the group through everything to do with <a href="https://github.com/pythonnortheast/introduction-1/blob/master/step-5-strings-formatting.py">string formatting</a> from Python 2 &amp; Python 3. It was really helpful to see how we&#8217;re all going to adapt from the &#8220;old (v2.x)&#8221; to the &#8220;new (v3.x)&#8221;</p>

<h2>Intro To Name Spaces</h2>

<p>Namespaces are great and <a href="http://davidjeffrey.co.uk">Dave Jeffery</a> took some time to []break it all down]<a href="step-6-imports.py">2</a> into byte sized chunks (<em>sorry, couldn&#8217;t resist the pun</em>).  For future reference don&#8217;t do this &hellip;</p>

<p><code>from os import *</code></p>

<p>Because if you do, you&#8217;ll turn Dave into a &#8217;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6vPRaIrvqU">sad panda</a>&#8217;.</p>

<h2>Show &amp; Tell - Ross Cooney</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.spoutingshite.com/about/">Ross Cooney</a> was super brave to be the first person to do out first show and tell &mdash; especially because it was his first ever python script.  Ross had developed a python script that would help him deploy config files and restart daemons to a number of machines on private networks accessible by one gateway machine.</p>

<p>What was really good about this was that members of the group were able to give some stellar feedback that offered increased security and performance boosts.</p>

<p>So we&#8217;ll be looking for someone else to do this next month - if you&#8217;re up for it, drop a line on our <a href="http://pythonnortheast.co.uk/group">group mailing list</a> or <a href="http://twitter.com/pythonnortheast">send us a tweet</a></p>

<h2>Building a Web App with Flask</h2>

<p>Due to a run over from last Month, Kieran&#8217;s talk got postponed until this month - it was worth the wait!</p>

<p>Kieran <a href="https://github.com/kierandarcy/qrimage">talked about building a QR image generation web app with Flask</a> and walked through it step by step with clarity.</p>

<p>It was really good to see flask used for something other than a simple API and really good to show the group how such a feat is acheived.  Kieran put loads of work into this demo and you can run through <a href="https://github.com/kierandarcy/qrimage-tutorial">the tutorial</a> step by step using the tags on the <a href="https://github.com/kierandarcy/qrimage-tutorial">tutorial git repository</a>.</p>

<p><code>git checkout step-1  # and then step-2, step-3 etc etc</code></p>

<h2>Other Awesomes</h2>

<p>We saw a few new faces at the meetup this month and loads of people from previous months proving that we&#8217;re forming into a nice little (for now!) community with a bright future ahead for 2013.</p>

<p>Mick Johnson from <a href="http://www.insquaremedia.com/">insquare media</a> wrote up a really nice <a href="http://www.insquaremedia.com/blog/14-what-we-re-doing/35-python-north-eastThanks">blog post about the lack of sandals and beards</a>. Though I should point out that Simon was sporting a fine beard this month.</p>

<p>We were super chuffed that Chris &amp; Chris (Father &amp; Son combo!) made it along.   Chris asked if we&#8217;d be doing any really basic introduction to python stuff and the short answer is yes, in fact we&#8217;re having a meeting in December (the 4th is the current date that&#8217;s been penciled in) and it&#8217;s one of the top issues that we&#8217;re going to tackle so watch this space.</p>

<p>in response to using the wonderful <a href="https://github.com/inglesp/prescons">prescon</a> for a few months, Dave has developed the idea further into something that runs in the browser. You can see a <a href="http://davidjeffrey.eu/static/pypres/test.html">demo of it</a> or <a href="https://github.com/jeffrhodeisland/pysenter">checkout the source code</a>. Kudos to <a href="http://mindfulmantis.com/">Sam Lambert</a> for suggesting the Name Pysenter.</p>

<h2>Official Meeting</h2>

<p>Now that the groups is really coming together we&#8217;re going to hold an official meeting at the start of December (provisionally the 4th).</p>

<p>We&#8217;ll be working from an <a href="http://openetherpad.org/python-north-east-official-meeting-dec-2012">agenda that we&#8217;re going to put together</a> over the next few weeks and the meeting will be chaired by myself (Jamie Curle) minutes will be taken by Dave Jeffery and everyone is welcome to attend.</p>

<p>Please do bear in mind however that this is not a meetup -  The meeting is our first &#8216;serious&#8217; official meeting so that we can decide a plan of action for the groups future  and <em>everything</em> will come from <a href="http://openetherpad.org/python-north-east-official-meeting-dec-2012">the meeting&#8217;s etherpad</a> which anyone is free to contribute to.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>We had a great night on Tuesday the 11th of September at the first meetup in a long while. We had 15 attendees and managed to chomp through 2 topics, 1 workshop, 10 pizzas and 4 bottles of pop.</p>

<h2>Slides</h2>

<p>The slides for <a href="https://github.com/pythonnortheast/slides/blob/master/2012/sep/11/ZODB.pdf?raw=true">Simon&#8217;s talk on ZODB</a> and <a href="https://github.com/pythonnortheast/slides/blob/master/2012/sep/11/virtualenv.pdf?raw=true">Dave&#8217;s talk on virtualenv</a> can both be found on <a href="https://github.com/pythonnortheast/">The Community Python North East Github</a> account.</p>

<h2>Next: October&#8217;s Meetup</h2>

<p>We also had some great ideas for next month&#8217;s talks and one volunteer - Kieran.
He&#8217;s volunteered to talk about Flask as an inroad to python web frameworks. However, we don&#8217;t have his contact details so if anyone could connect us, we&#8217;d be eternally grateful.</p>

<p>Potential topics for next month are &mdash;</p>

<ul>
<li>Python primitives - a community presentation of 3-5 min lightening talks on the primitive data types</li>
<li>Games design &amp; development with python</li>
<li>Case study of a live django project</li>
<li>1/2 hour workshop on setting up django projects</li>
</ul>


<h2>Getting Involved</h2>

<p>If you&#8217;ve got an idea for talk that you&#8217;d like to see, or even better, one that you&#8217;d like to give then <a href="https://groups.google.com/d/forum/python-north-east">post a discussion to the group</a>.</p>

<p>We&#8217;re really keen on developing the novices in the group and especially keen on everyone cutting their presenting teeth, so don&#8217;t feel like you&#8217;re not good enough to give a talk. If you can communicate with the outside world in anyway then you possess the skill to deliver a talk.</p>

<p>You don&#8217;t have to do the whole slide thing, if you want to communicate through the power of interpretative dance then that&#8217;s cool with us.</p>

<p>This is your group and it&#8217;s early days; it isn&#8217;t important how you get involved, it&#8217;s just important that you do. So <a href="https://twitter.com/PythonNorthEast">follow Python North East</a>, get <a href="https://groups.google.com/d/forum/python-north-east">involved in the discussions</a>, grab a <a href="http://pythonnortheast.eventbrite.co.uk">ticket for the next meetup</a> and start getting involved.</p>

<p>Cheers,</p>

<p>Python North East.</p>

<p>My money&#8217;s in that office, right? If she start giving me some bullshit about it ain&#8217;t there, and we got to go someplace else and get it, I&#8217;m gonna shoot you in the head then and there. Then I&#8217;m gonna shoot that bitch in the kneecaps, find out where my goddamn money is. She gonna tell me too. Hey, look at me when I&#8217;m talking to you, motherfucker. You listen: we go in there, and that nigga Winston or anybody else is in there, you the first motherfucker to get shot. You understand?</p>

<blockquote><p>Blockquote is what goes
inside this block here
would you believe that
bullshit?</p></blockquote>

<p>Well, the way they make shows is, they make one show. That show&#8217;s called a pilot. Then they show that show to the people who make shows, and on the strength of that one show they decide if they&#8217;re going to make more shows. Some pilots get picked and become television programs. Some don&#8217;t, become nothing. She starred in one of the ones that became nothing.</p>

<p>The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the iniquities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness, for he is truly his brother&#8217;s keeper and the finder of lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who would attempt to poison and destroy My brothers. And you will know My name is the Lord when I lay My vengeance upon thee.</p>

<p>Your bones don&#8217;t break, mine do. That&#8217;s clear. Your cells react to bacteria and viruses differently than mine. You don&#8217;t get sick, I do. That&#8217;s also clear. But for some reason, you and I react the exact same way to water. We swallow it too fast, we choke. We get some in our lungs, we drown. However unreal it may seem, we are connected, you and I. We&#8217;re on the same curve, just on opposite ends.</p>

<p>Do you see any Teletubbies in here? Do you see a slender plastic tag clipped to my shirt with my name printed on it? Do you see a little Asian child with a blank expression on his face sitting outside on a mechanical helicopter that shakes when you put quarters in it? No? Well, that&#8217;s what you see at a toy store. And you must think you&#8217;re in a toy store, because you&#8217;re here shopping for an infant named Jeb.</p>
